<section>
    <a href="../aboot.html"><button>⌂ Go to home</button></a>
    <p>With years of experience in managing and developing Minecraft servers, I’ve been involved in a wide range of projects, from community-driven servers to fully customized gamemodes. Below are some of the roles I’ve held and the skills I’ve developed throughout my career in Minecraft server administration.</p>

    <h2>Previous Roles:</h2>
    <div class="role">
        <h3>ReimaginedMC – Manager/Head Admin/Designer/Website Programmer</h3>
        <p>Co-founded ReimaginedMC with Pacerman29, serving as the primary developer behind its gamemodes, ideas, and even the full website design. My work shaped the server’s core experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="role">
        <h3>TheFunGensS2 – Lead Manager</h3>
        <p>Contributed to the development of new areas and ideas, assisted with Skript programming, and played a key role in overall server administration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="role">
        <h3>TurtleMC – Co-Owner/Owner (Shut down)</h3>
        <p>Founded TurtleMC, a server that was unfortunately taken from me due to a poor agreement. While the server has since shut down, I consider it a valuable learning experience—and hey, karma works in mysterious ways.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="role">
        <h3>Traitor – Developer/Web Programmer</h3>
        <p>Developed the website for the server, implemented game feature improvements, and contributed to enhancing game mechanics and overall user experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="role">
        <h3>Sunylex – Co-Owner/Designer</h3>
        <p>Helped design server features and managed its online presence, while also contributing to the creative direction and content development.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="role">
        <h3>Turtlenet – Owner</h3>
        <p>Took charge of Turtlenet, designing unique gamemodes and crafting original gameplay ideas with some support from other talented individuals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="role">
        <h3>The Wild Trials Network – Designer (Shut down)</h3>
        <p>Contributed logo designs and other creative assets for the server. Unfortunately, the project has since been abandoned, but it remains a part of my creative journey.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Key Skills:</h2>
    <div class="skills">
        <h3>Skript</h3>
        <p>Highly proficient in developing custom plugins and gameplay mechanics using Skript. I specialize in automating server functions and tailoring features to suit specific server needs.</p>

        <h3>Community Moderation</h3>
        <p>Experienced in moderating large Minecraft communities, ensuring a positive player experience while maintaining order and upholding server rules.</p>

        <h3>Plugin Setup & Configuration</h3>
        <p>Skilled in setting up and configuring plugins to optimize server functionality, whether it’s for simple utilities or complex, custom features.</p>

        <h3>Problem-Solving & Debugging</h3>
        <p>Known for quickly diagnosing issues with servers or plugins and finding effective solutions to improve performance, functionality, and player satisfaction.</p>

        <h3>Command Blocks</h3>
        <p>Extensive experience using Minecraft’s command blocks to create custom game rules, automate events, and develop complex gameplay features.</p>

        <h3>Custom Server Configuration</h3>
        <p>Adept at adjusting server settings, modifying world generation, and optimizing server performance—essentially, if it needs configuring, I can handle it.</p>
